# census_classification_project

The census classification project classifies census data using a decision tree to determine if a person earns more or less than $50k per year.

The main code is in census_classification.py. adult_test.py and adult_train.py are the testing and training data used for this project. features.txt contains descriptions of what each feature of data is, and the categories it could be if it is categorical.
